# java-movie-database-gui
Allows for manipulation of a movie review database using the Swing GUI library.
Parses movie reviews and organizes them into a hashset database. Every review has an ID, review text, predicted polarity using a black box algorithm, and a real polarity thatâ€™s preassigned. The program uses multithreading to allow for the GUI to render updates in the background, allowing the program to still be navigated through without hangs or freezes while parsing data.
